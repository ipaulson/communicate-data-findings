## Dataset




## Summary of Findings

Shanghai, Singapore, and Hong Kong scored at or near the top in all subejct areas. Peru scored lowest (of countries assessed) in all categories. Females scored higher than males in reading in all countries.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Like males, females who score higher in one subject area tend to score higher in other subject areas as well. In general, females do not score high in reading and low in math and science. Exploration of other variables will be necessary to understand this trend further.
